/**
 * Decision logic shared by the Neurai Connect screens.
 *
 * The screens are deliberately thin. Everything that decides *what* the user
 * is told and *whether* an approval may happen at all lives here, as pure
 * functions, for two reasons.
 *
 * The first is that these are exactly the decisions the protocol pins down:
 * which address signs a login and when the wallet may not sign at all
 * (spec/auth.md section 8), what a `sendTransfer` has to display before
 * anything is signed, and which methods this version answers instead of
 * refusing (spec/session.md section 3.4). Those deserve tests, and this
 * repository has no renderer wired up for these screens.
 *
 * The second is that a component that both renders and decides grows branches
 * no test ever reaches — and here the wrong branch means signing something the
 * user did not mean to sign.
 *
 * Nothing in this file imports React Native or the relay client, so it can be
 * exercised directly from `tests/unit/neurai-connect-screens.test.ts`.
