# NeuraiWallet

A mobile wallet for the [Neurai](https://neurai.org) blockchain, built with React Native for
Android and iOS. Keys are generated on the device and stored in the platform keystore; no seed
or private key ever leaves it.

NeuraiWallet is a fork of [BlueWallet](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet). The
navigation shell, the theming, the encrypted storage and the settings screens come from there;
the wallet, transaction, asset and messaging layers are Neurai's own and are built on the
`@neuraiproject/*` libraries (`neurai-key`, `neurai-jswallet`, `neurai-create-transaction`,
`neurai-sign-transaction`, `neurai-depin-msg`, `neurai-message`).

## What it does

* **HD wallets** on Neurai's BIP44 path, created from a 12-word mnemonic or imported from one.
* **Post-quantum wallets** signed with ML-DSA-44, using bech32m `AuthScript` addresses.
* **Hardware wallet** support over USB serial for the Neurai ESP32 signer: the device holds the
  seed and signs; the phone only builds and broadcasts.
* **Neurai Assets** — the native tokens of the chain (root, sub, unique/NFT, owner, restricted,
  qualifier and DePIN assets) are listed per wallet and can be sent from the Send screen.
* **DePIN messaging** — a token-gated chat tab (see below).
* **Neurai Connect** — QR login and dApp sessions (see below).
* **Privacy pool (C7 and C6, testnet)** — private XNA and asset notes with zero-knowledge proofs
  built on the phone (see below).
* Inherited from BlueWallet and still in use: encrypted storage with plausible deniability,
  biometric unlock on the sensitive screens, "is it my address?" verification, raw transaction
  broadcast, fiat rates and 50+ UI languages.

## Networks

Six chain identifiers are wired in parallel, one per network for each wallet kind: Legacy
P2PKH, ECDSA witness v3 and post-quantum. Switching the active network changes the backend URL,
the address prefixes, the BIP44 coin type and the bech32m HRP in one step. They are defined in
`blue_modules/neurai/networkConfig.ts`:

| Chain | Network | Keys | Addresses | BIP44 coin type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `xna` | mainnet | legacy ECDSA (secp256k1) | base58, P2PKH version 53 (`N…`) | 1900 |
| `xna-test` | testnet | legacy ECDSA (secp256k1) | base58, P2PKH version 127 | 1 |
| `xna-ecdsa` | mainnet | ECDSA (secp256k1), `m/84'` | bech32m strict ECDSA v3, HRP `nq` (`nq1r…`) | 1900 |
| `xna-ecdsa-test` | testnet | ECDSA (secp256k1), `m/84'` | bech32m strict ECDSA v3, HRP `tnq` (`tnq1r…`) | 1 |
| `xna-pq` | mainnet | post-quantum ML-DSA-44 | bech32m AuthScript v1, HRP `nc` (`nc1p…`) | 1900 |
| `xna-pq-test` | testnet | post-quantum ML-DSA-44 | bech32m strict PQ v2, HRP `tpq` (`tpq1z…`) | 1 |

These are the app's own names. `neurai-key` 5 reuses `xna` / `xna-pq` for other address types,
so every direct call goes through `blue_modules/neurai/keyNetwork.ts`; the Legacy and mainnet PQ
derivations are unchanged (mainnet PQ addresses keep their commitment, re-encoded from the old
`nq1p…`). Testnet was reset with a new genesis: testnet PQ wallets moved to the node's strict PQ
type, and cached testnet state (balances, history, DePIN pins and sessions) from the old chain is
discarded on load (`AbstractNeuraiWallet.fromJson`, `blue_modules/neurai/testnetReset.ts`).

ECDSA and PQ wallets can only be created on testnet for now: the node accepts witness v3 and v2
outputs only where those families are active, so the mainnet options stay disabled until then.
ECDSA wallets use ordinary compressed secp256k1 keys. DePIN RPC 5 supports both Legacy and strict ECDSA chat identities; PQ messaging remains deferred.

Balances, history, UTXOs and broadcast go through `neurai-wallet-services` over WSS by default
(`blue_modules/neurai/WssBackend.ts`), with a JSON-RPC backend as an explicit fallback
(`RpcBackend.ts`). Both endpoints can be overridden per network from Settings → Network.

## DePIN messaging

Neurai's DePIN assets (`&NAME`) carry a chat: holders of the same token can message each other
end to end encrypted, relayed by a DePIN-enabled Neurai node rather than by a server of ours.
The app derives a dedicated account-100 chat identity: `m/44'/coin'/100'/0/0` for Legacy wallets and `m/84'/coin'/100'/0/0` for ECDSA wallets. The selected exact address is passed to neurai-depin-msg 4.x; a key is not silently changed to its Legacy alias.

Requests use RPC 5 through the selected HTTP/WSS backend. Bootstrap pins the expected genesis, pool key and root. Every addressed call signs all arguments and the verified instance/membership context; replies are authenticated against the locally computed request hash before decryption. The WSS backend includes `depin.receive_seq` and serializes cursor integers exactly.

Reads use admission sequences instead of sender timestamps/hashes. The full cursor is kept with its decrypted history in memory, scoped to the endpoint/address/token. Nonces cannot cross an instance/revision, address or scope. Membership changes refresh recipients and renew challenges; a read has one bounded recovery attempt. A changed stream restarts pagination with hash deduplication. Late messages with old sender timestamps are not skipped, and bounded page loops continue on the next poll.

The recipient picker reads a verified directory. Private messages select the exact recipient plus the sender, including ECDSA destinations, even if the complete group is larger than a single message allows. Group limits and complete-directory requirements are enforced locally. The existing independent recipient audit remains advisory; a pool signature is not independent proof of asset ownership.

A one-tap reveal spends from the chat identity to publish its key. Settings select the wallet service endpoint. PQ messaging is not enabled. ESP32 firmware and its separate SDK are explicitly deferred: hardware messaging reports the missing RPC 5 support instead of attempting old unsigned/legacy reads or opening an obsolete authentication session.

The published `@neuraiproject/neurai-rpc@0.8.0` and `@neuraiproject/neurai-depin-msg@4.0.0` are installed from npm. Exact versions and registry integrity are pinned in `package-lock.json`.

## Neurai Connect

Neurai Connect is the wallet ↔ web link: a site shows a QR code, the user scans it with
NeuraiWallet, approves on the phone, and the site is either logged in ("Sign in with Neurai",
a CAIP-122 message signed with the chosen address) or holds a dApp session it can later use to
ask the wallet for `getAccountAddresses` and `signMessage`. Legacy and ECDSA software wallets also
answer `signPsbt` and `neurai_getAccountXpub` when the site lists them as optional methods
(`sendTransfer` is declared by the `bip122` profile but not implemented yet). Traffic goes through a relay
that only ever sees opaque encrypted blobs and random topics; no private key leaves the device.

- **`signPsbt`**: the wallet decodes the PSBT before anything is signed. It shows every output
  with its address and asset, what comes back to the wallet, what leaves it and the fee
  (`blue_modules/neurai/connect/psbt.ts`). It signs only the requested inputs of its own addresses,
  only with SIGHASH_ALL, and returns `partialSig` entries for the site to finalize. It never broadcasts.
  Post-quantum inputs are refused, because a PSBT has no field for an ML-DSA-44 signature.
- **`neurai_getAccountXpub`** (Neurai extension): after the user approves, the wallet returns
  `{ xpub, path, addressType }` for account 0: `m/44'/coin'/0'` for Legacy and `m/84'/coin'/0'` for ECDSA
  (`blue_modules/neurai/connect/xpub.ts`). With it, a site sees every receive (`0/i`) and change (`1/i`)
  address but cannot spend. The wallet shares the account key, never the master key.
The wallet side lives in `blue_modules/neurai/connect/` (relay client, session storage, signer,
per-domain identities) with the approval screens in `screen/connect/`, and pairings arrive as
`nc:` URIs from the scanner or as `neuraiwallet://connect?uri=…` deep links, recognised by
`class/neurai-uri-match.ts`.

## Privacy pool (C7 and C6, testnet)

Testnet Legacy and PQ wallets with their words get a **Privacy** button next to the wallet tabs.
It opens the TEST pools pinned in `blue_modules/neurai/privacy/c7-testnet.json` and `c6-*.json`
(the same instances as the web wallet), each with its own private balance and encrypted history:

* **C7 · XNA** (default): NeuraiZK/v3. One private wallet with any number of unlinkable `tnzk1…`
  version 3 addresses and fast recovery (one curve multiplication per published note, no address
  gap). Same circuits and proving files as C6; the instance is checked against its verifiable
  birth (its domain must derive from the genesis, the UNIQUE emission and the pool name).
* **C6 · XNA** and **C6 · asset** (an ordinary asset; asset operations pay the miner fee with a
  separate XNA sponsor coin).

Deposit, assign to `tnzk1…` addresses, withdraw and join two notes.

Hermes has no WebAssembly, so the proving side of `@neuraiproject/neurai-privacy` (snarkjs,
Argon2id, pool scanning) runs in a hidden WebView (`components/privacy/PrivacyHost.tsx`). Its
page is bundled from `privacy-host/` by `npm run privacy:host` (run by `postinstall`) into the
git-ignored `blue_modules/neurai/privacy/hostHtml.generated.ts`. The app keeps the library's
worker client, the encrypted journals (`privacy/store.ts`), RPC through the wallet's WSS service
and signing (`privacy/wallet.ts`); `privacy/bridge.ts` relays the worker's messages.

The proving files (~88 MB per instance) are downloaded on first use and kept only if their size
and SHA-256 match the pins in the app, so any HTTPS host will do. By default they come from the
testnet web wallet, which deploys the same pinned files (`https://webwallet-testnet.neurai.org`
plus the manifest's `artifactBaseUrl`: `/privacy-c7/` for C7, `/privacy-c6/` for C6); the URL can
be changed per pool in the privacy screen. To mirror them to a GitHub release
(`c7-test-<commitment[0:12]>` / `c6-test-<commitment[0:12]>`) instead:

```bash
node scripts/privacy-artifacts-release.mjs c7    ../neurai-webwallet/public/privacy-c7
node scripts/privacy-artifacts-release.mjs xna   ../neurai-webwallet/public/privacy-c6
node scripts/privacy-artifacts-release.mjs asset ../neurai-webwallet/public/privacy-c6-assets/C6ASSET261004A
# verified? add --publish (needs an authenticated GitHub CLI)
```

`privacy-host/e2e/run.sh <artifacts-dir>` checks the WebView page end to end in headless
Chromium (Docker): private wallet derivation, a real pool scan on testnet and a real Groth16
deposit proof whose files cross the bridge.

## Build and run

Node 22.11.0 or newer is required (see the `engines` field in `package.json`). Check yours with
`node --version && npm --version`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuraiproject/NeuraiWallet.git
cd NeuraiWallet
npm install
```

Start the Metro bundler in one terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

Then, in another terminal:

```bash
npm run android        # build and install on a connected device or emulator
npm run ios            # build and run on the iOS simulator
```

For iOS you need the CocoaPods dependencies first (`npx pod-install`), and for macOS via Mac
Catalyst open `ios/BlueWallet.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the `BlueWallet` scheme (the Xcode
project still carries the upstream name).

Useful extras while developing:

```bash
npm run adb              # adb reverse tcp:8081, so a device can reach Metro
npm run android:relaunch # force-stop and relaunch the installed app
npm run clean            # gradle clean + wipe caches and node_modules, then npm i
npm run clean:ios        # wipe node_modules and Pods, reinstall, reset the Metro cache
npm run android:clean    # gradle clean, then rebuild and run on Android
```

## Tests

```bash
npm test           # everything: lint + unit + integration
npm run lint       # tsc --noEmit, unused-loc-key check, then eslint
npm run lint:fix   # the same, applying eslint's fixes
npm run unit       # jest tests/unit/* only
npm run integration  # jest tests/integration/* (needs test mnemonics in the environment)
```

The unit suite is the one to run while working; it is self-contained and mocks the native
modules in `tests/setup.js`. Integration tests talk to real Neurai endpoints and expect
mnemonics in environment variables. End-to-end tests use Detox on Android:

```bash
npm run e2e:debug         # build a debug APK if needed, then run the e2e suite
npm run e2e:release-test  # run the suite against a release build
```
