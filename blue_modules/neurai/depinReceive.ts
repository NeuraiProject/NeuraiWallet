/**
 * Authenticated receive under RPC 5.
 *
 * The old call was `depinreceivemsg(token, address, timestamp)` and the node
 * refuses it outright: reading a holder's messages now requires proving control
 * of the address. The proof is a single-use nonce from `depinchallenge`, signed
 * by that address, and it expires in 30 seconds.
 *
 * Each authenticated reply carries a `next_challenge` (valid 300 s), so a poll
 * loop chains them instead of asking for a fresh nonce every page. The chain is
 * strictly SERIAL: a nonce is single-use, so two overlapping reads would spend
 * the same one and the second would be rejected.
 *
 * Everything the protocol requires — verifying the pool signature before
 * decrypting, checking each sender's signature over the recomputed digest,
 * scope and size limits — happens inside `receiveDepinMessages`. This module
 * only owns the chaining and the expiry policy, which is what the app has to
 * get right.
