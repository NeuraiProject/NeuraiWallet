/**
 * Tracks how much of a DePIN channel the user has already seen, so the wallet
 * can show a "new activity" marker without decrypting anything.
 *
 * A verified RPC 5 bootstrap exposes the stream and admission high water in
 * its signed public body. The background check requires no user key or device.
 * The marker advances after the chat finishes scanning its receive pages.
 *
 * What it cannot tell is whether the new traffic is addressed to *you*: only
 * decryption answers that, and that is exactly the work we are avoiding here.
 * The marker therefore means "this channel has new messages", which may include
 * messages you will not be able to read.
 *
 * The signature is stored per wallet, not per node: two wallets can watch the
 * same channel, and reading it in one must not silence the marker in the other.
 * A wallet id is available without touching the device, which a DePIN address
 * is not on a hardware wallet.
