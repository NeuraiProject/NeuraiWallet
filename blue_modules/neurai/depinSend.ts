/**
 * Sending a DePIN message under RPC 5.
 *
 * Replaces the hand-rolled assembly the app used to do — fetch each recipient's
 * key with `getpubkey`, build, wrap, submit — with the library calls that carry
 * the protocol's checks:
 *
 *   `buildDepinMessageForPool` resolves the recipient set through the pool and
 *   REFUSES any entry whose public key does not hash to its address. The old
 *   `getpubkey` path accepted whatever the server answered, so a hostile
 *   endpoint could hand back its own key for a real holder's address and read
 *   the message. That check is the reason this path exists.
 *
 *   `submitDepinMessage` wraps the message for the pool, submits it, and
 *   verifies the confirmation's `poolsig` before opening it. The node refuses a
 *   bare hex payload outright, so wrapping is not optional.
 *
 * What remains outside the library's reach is whether a listed address really
 * holds the token: that is on-chain data, checked separately and independently
 * by `depinRecipientAudit`.
